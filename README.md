## General PLC Programming Course

# **This course is in the beginning stages of development**

### Goal: 

The goal of the course is to teach PLC (Ladder Logic) programming so that large programs can 
be reduced down to a set of functions or modules. Using the techinques discuss will allows a team to work on 
a project. Also, allows an individual with no prior knowledge of the system to quicky understand and modify the
code in a time sensitive manner.

- Structured Programming
