#General PLC programming course with emphasize on the used of different programming paradigms.

##The course explores the following paraigms: 
  
-Procedural Programming 

-Imperative Programming

-Structured Programming

The goal of the course is to teach PLC (Ladder Logic) programming that so larger complicated programs can 
be reduced down to a set of functions or modules. Using these techinques discuss will allows a team to work on 
a project. Also, allows an individual with no prior knowledge of the system to quicky understand and modify the
code in a time sensitive manner.
